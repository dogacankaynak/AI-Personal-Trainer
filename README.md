# AI-Personal-Trainer

This project done by using opencv, media pipe and numpy. The comments are helpful to understand the algorithm. If you need explanation, you can contact with me!

Instead of biceps curl, it can be used for other exercises(shoulder press, chest press etc.). You just need to change shoulder, elbow and wrist variables according to graphic underneath the title of "Setting Up Coordinates". Also you need to change stages and curling logic of algorithm, if you are going to use algorithm for another exercise.
